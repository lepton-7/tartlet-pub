# Transcriptionally-active Riboswitch Tracer (TaRT)

Finds transcriptional riboswitch activity in RNA-seq data.

## Validation

TaRT is validated on published transcriptomic and metatranscriptomic datasets. Datasets are downloaded with  `validation/rna_seq/download_SRAs.sh` using compilation lists of SRA run IDs.
